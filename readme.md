Script that will generate an ASCII art image from a given image file or web camera. [**Try it out at here.**](https://kuruparans.github.io/asky)

ASCII image art width will expand to window size. Optional settings available to invert image or use different brightness formula settings (only works with colour images). Requires webcam access or image file upload. No data is shared or stored remotely. Just plain client side Javascript.
